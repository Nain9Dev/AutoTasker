# AutoTasker API

A .NET 8 REST API for automating and scheduling rotating on-call duties and recurring team tasks. This project is built to demonstrate modern backend development practices, including Clean Architecture, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and secure external API integration.

This API is the backend for the AutoTasker system, designed to be consumed by any front-end client or service.
